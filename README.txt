Title: Integral Calculator (TrapezoidSum)

Description: The user inputs a function (as a string), an upper bound, a lower bound, and a set amount of trapezoids to use.
             The calculator takes into account all of these variables to make trapezoids at every interval and approximate
             the integral's value.
             
Side Note: All functions must have "x" as the independent variable. 
Side Note 2: I am currently tinkering with the calculator to work with two independent variables (x, y) and solve for rectangular bounds.
